### Purpose

Due to the use of herbicides and pesticides on farms, and the resulting environmental impacts, audit trails are kept to ensure quality assurance requirements for pre-harvest chemical applications. The purpose of our application is to allow chemical-distributing farm workers to easily record all relevant information, moving the farm towards more efficient and environmentally friendly (fully digital) record keeping. The application will also allow the generation of reports for use by farm managers in auditing meetings.

The benefits this application could bring to the farm include a streamlining of the record-keeping process, addition of photographic evidence, as well as increased transparency, efficiency and data security.
